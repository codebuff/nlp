Comment : in this task only detection accuracy have been calculated , for calculating correction accuracy one approach could be try out all the permutation and see if it crosses threshold and compare against actual correct word, another approach would be to use frequencies from confusion matrices, however could not decide on which one thus it has been avoided

*Comparison of performance (execution speed) between Linear Dictionary / Brute Force Approach and Hashed Dictionary / Bit map Approach*

A custom hashmap has been implemented which does increase the detection speed, however correction speed is still slower than dictionary approach  likely due to assumption while searching in dictionary approach .

Correcting by dictionary approach takes around 30 seconds and with bitmap approach takes around 200 seconds on same test data 
In order to increase the speed in bitmap searching one suggestion is only look for string of same length as incorrect word instead of length , length + 1 and length - 1 but that would bring down the correction accuracy of bitmap approach which is higher than dictionary approach.

##### Notes about MED outputs

###### BackTraceMED output
*Multiple paths are not taken into account*

While calculating MED if there are multiple possible paths with same score then order of preference is deletion > insertion > substitution

that's why

when alignment or steps is printed in output,most of the times they will be entirely composed of insertion and deletion only

###### WeightedMED output
*Generation of Confusion Matrices*

Multiple paths are not taken into account

While calculating MED if there are multiple possible paths with same score then order of preference is deletion > insertion > substitution

that's why

The counts in substitution matrix will be updated far less times than deletion or insertion matrices

As a result of this

when alignment or steps is printed in output,most of the times they will be mostly composed of substitution only since every count in all the matrices are initialized with zero and substitution matrices is highly likely to contain zeroes leading to substitution path being chosen when path is selected by algorithm dynamically
